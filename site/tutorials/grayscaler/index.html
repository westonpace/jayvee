<p>In this tutorial we are going to be making a system which turns images from color images to grayscale images. For lack of creativity we'll call it a grayscaler. This is perhaps the simplest of image transformations, typically one takes the average of the different colors:</p> 
<p> gray = (red + green + blue) / 3 </p> 
<p>Of course, even with something as simple as this, there is more than one way to do it.<br />You could take advantage of the fact that the human eye perceives some colors more strongly than others and compute a more natural looking gray:</p> 
<p> gray = red * 0.3 + green * .059 + blue * .11 </p> 
<p>You could convert the image to an HSL format and simply take the luminosity:</p> 
<p> gray = 0.5 * max ( red , green , blue ) + 0.5 * min ( red , green , blue ) </p> 
<p>You could even convert the image to an image that only uses 4 different shades of gray (or 50). In this tutorial we don't care how you do the actual conversion. Since we're boring we'll be using the basic averaging method but you're welcome to use any method you want.</p>

 <h2 id="An_Overview_of_the_Pieces">An Overview of the Pieces</h2> 
 <p>JayVee works by connecting pieces together which each perform some kind of individual task. For this demo we'll need the following pieces:</p>

	<div class="row columns columns3">
		<div class="span4">
			<h3 id="Source_of_Image_Files">Source of Image Files</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/binary-input.svg" style="width:100%;" alt="binary data appearing from the ether" /></p>
<p>In order to conver images into grayscale we need, you guessed it, images. JayVee supports receiving images in a number of different ways, from the filesystem, a webcam, the internet, pre-canned datasets, videos, etc. For this tutorial our images will come from the filesystem.</p>
<div class="section">

		<div class="span4">
			<h3 id="Image_Reader">Image Reader</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/binary-to-rgb.svg" style="width:100%;" alt="binary data going to rgb pixels" /></p>
<p>Image files are merely a collection of bytes stored off somewhere. To really make use of them we need to parse those bytes into an array of pixels, more commonly known as an image. An image reader can take in a stream of bytes and produce images or streams of pixels.</p>
<div class="section">

			<h3 id="Grayscaler">Grayscaler</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/rgb-to-gray.svg" style="width:100%;" alt="rgb pixels going to gray pixels" /></p>
<p>This is the part we'll write ourselves. We need something which takes in one image, a color image, and spits out another image, a gray image. We'll go into quite a bit of detail around how we produce this piece.</p>

<p>Once we have a destination, we need to turn that image back into a stream of bits. The image writer conveniently does this, exactly the opposite of the image reader. As you can tell our lack of creativity extends into naming as well.</p>

<p>Just like we need images, we also need a place to put the images once we're done. Again, there are a number of choices. We could display the images on screen in a gallery, in a slideshow, or as a video stream. We could pipe the bytes off into the ether. Or, we can simply write them back out to the disk in a new location. As we've already established the fact that we're boring, we'll simply be writing them to disk in this tutorial.</p>

			<h2 id="Workers_They_do_the_Work">Workers (They do the Work)</h2>
<p>The thing that makes JayVee different than most other vision librarys out there is JayVee's workflow system. In this system a set of workers are connected to each other through buffers. Each worker has sources (which it receives data from) and sinks (which it sends data to). To see an example, lets look at our first two pieces, the <a href="../../../jayvee-core/0.1/apidocs/com/github/westonpace/jayvee/image/io/DirectoryScanner.html">DirectoryScanner</a>, and the <a href="../../../jayvee-core/0.1/apidocs/com/github/westonpace/jayvee/image/io/jse/ImageIOImageReader.html">ImageIOImageReader</a>.</p>
<p>The directory scanner is our source of image files mentioned above. It walks through a directory, grabs every file, and passes the file on. The directory scanner is a worker. It sends its files forwards with the help of a sink. In particular, we see it has a sink of input streams named generatedInputStreams:</p>
<div class="source"> 
 <pre>public class DirectoryScanner {

    //...

    public Sink&lt;InputStream&gt; generatedInputStreams;

    //...

}
</pre> 
</div>
<p>The next step in our chain is the image reader. It takes in input streams and turns them into images. In particular, the ImageIOImageReader uses Java's ImageIO class to do the reading of images. Once again, the image reader is a worker. However, instead of a just a sink, the image reader has both a source and a sink:</p>
<div class="source"> 
 <pre>public class ImageIOImageReader {

    //...

    public Source&lt;InputStream&gt; inputStreamsToRead;
    public Sink&lt;Image&gt; generatedImages;

    //...

}
</pre> 
</div>
<p>Every worker in JayVee is going to have at least one source or sink. Most workers are going to have at least one of each. These workers with both are the ones that are actually doing the work. They are taking in images and creating image pyramids, taking in features to track and creating tracked features, or taking in streams of pixels and spitting out locations of faces.</p>
<p>Also, you'll notice that the sink on the directory scanner and the source on the image reader are the same type (InputStream). Doesn't this make you want to just connect the two pieces together?</p>
<div class="section">            
</div>

	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span12">
			<h2 id="Creating_your_own_worker">Creating your own worker</h2>
<p>Alright, it's time to get this demo started. We're going to create a worker of our own now. This worker will be the worker that actually converts the RGB image into a grayscale image. Being our typical creative selves we are going to call the class <tt>GrayscaleFilter</tt> but you can call it whatever you want. </p>
<p>In order to create worker we need to implement the Worker interface. Actually, since we don't need any special initialization or teardown we can just extend the StandardWorker abstract class (which provides basic setup and teardown). That means we only have to worry about:</p>
<div class="source"> 
 <pre>public abstract class StandardWorker {

    //...

    public abstract void iterate();

    //...

}
</pre> 
</div>
<p>The <tt>iterate</tt> method will be called repeatedly until we're finished. With all workers this method does the same thing. It reads in some input from its sources, processes that input, and sends the resulting objects to its sinks. Which reminds me, we'll also need sources and sinks. The sources or sinks can be public properties or 
 <s>
   private properties with getter and setter methods 
 </s> (not for the 0.1 release). For this example, we're going to use public properties.</p>
<p>Our grayscale filter will be taking in images, transforming them, and outputting images so putting everything together we get:</p>
<div class="source"> 
 <pre>public class GrayscaleFilter extends StandardWorker {

    public Source&lt;Image&gt; inputImages;
    public Sink&lt;Image&gt; outputImages;

    private void convertToGrayscale(Image colorImage) {
        //We'll leave this part up to you
    }

    public void iterate() {
        Image colorImage = inputImages.pop();
        Image grayImage = convertToGrayscale(colorImage);
        outputImages.push(grayImage);
    }

}
</pre> 
</div>
<p>Simple, right? 
 <!-- -
## Closing the loop (a minor detour) --> Before we talk about how we're going to connect all these workers together lets go ahead and talk about the rest of the components, e.g. writing the images back out. To write our images we're going to go ahead and use the <a href="../../../jayvee-core/0.1/apidocs/com/github/westonpace/jayvee/image/io/jse/ImageIOImageWriter.html">ImageIOImageWriter</a>. This component needs 3 different pieces of input to operate:</p>
<div class="source"> 
 <pre>public class ImageIOImageWriter extends StandardWorker {

    //...

    public Source&lt;OutputStream&gt; outputStreamsToWriteTo;
    public Source&lt;Image&gt; imagesToWrite;
    public Source&lt;String&gt; imageFormats;

    //...

}
</pre> 
</div>
<p>The <tt>imagesToWrite</tt> should be easy enough to supply, that is simply the output of our filter. The output streams to write to controls where our output will end up. Again, to be boring, we are simply going to write our images back onto the filesystem. To do this we will use the <a href="../../../jayvee-core/0.1/apidocs/com/github/westonpace/jayvee/image/io/IncrementingFileCreator.html">IncrementingFileCreator</a>. This worker creates output streams in a given directory. Each output stream will have a unique number sandwiched between a standard preifx and suffix. In other words, it will create files like img-0.png, img-1.png, if we supply img as the prefix and .png as the suffix. </p>
<p>The final input to the image writer is the image format. This is required by the ImageIO library and tells the library what the file format should be. Sample values are things like png, bmp, and jpg. For simplicity, in this tutorial, we are just going to write all of our images out as bmp. To do this we will supply the image write with the ConstantSource class which takes a value and spits that value out into the buffer over and over again like a broken record.</p>

			<h2 id="Building_the_system">Building the system</h2>
<p>Now we have all of our pieces. It's time to connect them all together. There are a number of ways to do this. 
 <s>
   You can use the GUI builder to configure and connect your system. You can use your favorite IoC container like Spring or Guice. 
 </s> (not in 0.1) Finally, you can also build the system programatically with the SystemBuilder. For this tutorial we will use the system builder.</p>
<p>To use the system builder we need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> 
 <li>Create a SystemBuilder</li> 
 <li>Instantiate the workers</li> 
 <li>Configure the workers</li> 
 <li>Connect the workers</li> 
 <li>Build the system</li> 
</ol>
<p>The first step is simple enough. Lets go ahead and make the main method for our application and get started:</p>
<div class="source"> 
 <pre>public class MainClass {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        SystemBuilder systemBuilder = new SystemBuilder();
    }

}
</pre> 
</div>
<div class="section">    
</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span12">
			<h3 id="Instantiating_the_workers">Instantiating the workers</h3>
<p>Rather than new up the workers ourselves, we let the system builder instantiate the workers for us. This is required because the system builder is responsible for pre-processing and post-processing the generated workers. (Note: In 0.2 this step has been removed in favor of standard instantiation, so just bear with me)</p>
<div class="source"> 
 <pre>public class MainClass {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        SystemBuilder systemBuilder = new SystemBuilder();

        DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = builder.buildWorker(DirectoryScanner.class);
        ImageIOImageReader imageReader = builder.buildWorker(ImageIOImageReader.class);
        ToGrayscale toGrayscale = builder.buildWorker(ToGrayscale.class);
        IncrementingFileCreator directoryWriter = builder.buildWorker(IncrementingFileCreator.class);
        ImageIOImageWriter imageWriter = builder.buildWorker(ImageIOImageWriter.class);
        @SuppressWarnings(&quot;unchecked&quot;)
        ConstantSource&lt;String&gt; formatSource = builder.buildWorker(ConstantSource.class);

    }

}
</pre> 
</div>
<div class="section">    
</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span12">
			<h3 id="Configuring_the_workers">Configuring the workers</h3>
<p>Once instantiated the workers are just like any other Java object and so we'll configure them by setting the various properties. Feel free to adjust this configuration to suit your particular preferences:</p>
<div class="source"> 
 <pre>public class MainClass {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        //...
        ConstantSource&lt;String&gt; formatSource = builder.buildWorker(ConstantSource.class);

        directoryScanner.setDirectory(&quot;/input-images&quot;);
        directoryWriter.setDirectory(&quot;/output-images&quot;);
        directoryWriter.setPrefix(&quot;img&quot;);
        directoryWriter.setSuffix(&quot;.bmp&quot;);
        formatSource.setValue(&quot;bmp&quot;);

    }

}

	<div class="row">
		<div class="span12">
			<h3 id="Connecting_the_workers">Connecting the workers</h3>
<p>The system builder can magically connect two workers for us. All we need to do is supply it with the sink of one worker and the source of another workers. It will take care of worrying about multiple sources and sinks, how to synchronize access, whether a worker is request only or not, all kinds of stuff that we don't really care about. The one thing we may want to specify however is the size of the buffer between the two workers.</p>
<p>One of the dangerous things about images is that they tend to be large. Typically we're used to working with compressed images and so we don't notice these things. If you have a 1 megapixel image (e.g. 1024x1024), it has 3 bands, and we represent each value as a double then you're looking at <tt>1024*1024*3*8 = 24 megabytes</tt>. Even smart phones have 8 megapixel cameras these days, and an 8 megapixel image is going to be 160 megabytes. If we don't specify a max buffer size, then it will default to something rather large (over 100) and if that buffer fills up with 8 megapixel images then we'd have over 16 gigabytes worth of images in memory. Or more accurately, we wouldn't because the application would crash first. That is why we specify buffers of max size 1 when working with images buffers below:</p>
<div class="source"> 
 <pre>public class MainClass {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        //...
        directoryWriter.setSuffix(&quot;.bmp&quot;);

        builder.connect(directoryScanner.generatedInputStreams, imageReader.inputStreamsToRead, 10);
        builder.connect(imageReader.generatedImages, toGrayscale.inputImages, 1);
        builder.connect(toGrayscale.outputImages, imageWriter.imagesToWrite, 1);
        builder.connect(directoryWriter.generatedOutputStreams, imageWriter.outputStreamsToWriteTo, 10);
        builder.connect(formatSource.outputSink, imageWriter.imageFormats, 10);

     }

}
</pre> 
</div>
<div class="section">     
</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span12">
			<h3 id="Building_and_running_the_system">Building and running the system</h3>
<p>At this point we are ready to build the system. The builder knows about all the workers. All the workers have been configured. All the workers have been connected. The last part is easy:</p>
<div class="source"> 
 <pre>public class MainClass {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        //...
        builder.connect(formatSource.outputSink, imageWriter.imageFormats, 10);

        WorkflowSystem system = builder.build();
        system.start();
        system.join();
     }

 }
</pre> 
</div>
<p>That's it. Go ahead, test it out, see what results you get. If you run into any bugs make sure to file them.</p>
