The core JayVee library provides the fundamental copmonents of JayVee.  Primarily, it 
provides the basic {@linkplain com.pace.jayvee.workflow workflow system} which is the 
foundation for the entire JayVee architecture.  Familiarity with this system is highly 
recommended for any developer using JayVee.

In addition, this library provides the base {@link com.pace.jayvee.image.Image Image} 
interface which is used throughout JayVee.  This library also provides basic routines 
for {@linkplain com.pace.jayvee.image.io I/O} and simple 
{@linkplain com.pace.jayvee.image.worker.basic image  transformations}.
